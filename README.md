# Climate Cast

## Overview
Climate Cast is a weather dashboard application that allows users to search for cities and view their current weather conditions and 5-day weather forecast. It also provides a search history functionality to save and quickly access previously searched cities. The application utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.

## Features
- <b>Search History Functionality</b>: Users can search for cities, and the application saves and displays their search history. Clicking on a city in the search history fetches and presents the current and future weather conditions for that city.
- <b>Current Weather Conditions Display</b>: The application presents the city name, date, weather condition icon, temperature, humidity, and wind speed of the searched city.
- <b>Future Weather Forecast Display</b>: The application displays a 5-day weather forecast with the date, weather condition icon, temperature, wind speed, and humidity for each day.
- <b>Data Persistence Functionality</b>: The search history is persisted across user sessions, allowing users to see their previous search history even after closing and reopening the application.
- <b>Refresh Weather Information Functionality</b>: Users can refresh the weather data of a city to fetch and present the most up-to-date weather conditions.

## Usage Guide

- Press the "Enter" key or click the search button.
